# Pagination Project

## Overview

This project involves implementing pagination for a dataset using various techniques. You will learn how to paginate data with simple parameters, incorporate hypermedia metadata, and ensure pagination remains functional even when items are deleted. The project uses Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and follows the `pycodestyle` style guide.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

1. How to paginate a dataset with simple `page` and `page_size` parameters.
2. How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
3. How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Requirements

- Python version: 3.7
- Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Code Style: `pycodestyle` version 2.5.*
- Documentation: All modules, functions, and coroutines must be documented and type-annotated.

## Setup
